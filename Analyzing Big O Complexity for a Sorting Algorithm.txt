Case Study: Analyzing Big O Complexity for a Sorting Algorithm
Objective: The objective of this case study is to analyze the Big O complexity of a given sorting algorithm and understand its efficiency concerning different input sizes.

Problem Statement: Consider a sorting algorithm that arranges an array of integers in ascending order. The challenge is to analyze the Big O complexity of the algorithm and assess its efficiency in various scenarios.

def simple_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
Task 1: Identifying Key Operations
Analyze the provided algorithm and identify the key operations it performs.

Outer loop (for i in range(n)):
The loop runs n times, where n is the length of the array.

Inner loop ( for j in range(0, n-i-1)):
for each iteration of i the inner loop runs n - i -1 times
this is to compare the elements next to each other and then moving them to the end of the array

comparing (if arr[j] > arr[j+1]):
checks to see if the current element is greater

swap (arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]):
this swaps the elements if they are out of order.

This algorithm compares and swaps elements.


Task 2: Calculating Big O Complexity
Apply the principles of Big O notation to express how the algorithm's runtime grows concerning the size of the input

In the best case scenario this algorithm is an O(n) but on average this algorithm does not take advantage of this array being sorted already making it O(n^2)

As the size of the input grows the runtime will also grow. It is a simple but very inefficient way to sort.
 

Task 3: Efficiency Analysis:

This algorithm os inefficientfor large databases due to the fact that it has the worst time complexity of O(n^2).

It does unnecessary comparisons even if the array is already semi-sorted.

def simple_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

def optimized_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            break

The optimization that I put takes advantage of the already sorted array. It is called a swap flag insuring that there are no wasted comparisons and making the best time complexity O(n.)
